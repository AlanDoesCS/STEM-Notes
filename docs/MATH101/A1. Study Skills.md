## Reading Proofs

What to do after reading each line:
Consider:
- Do I understand the ideas used in that line?
- Do I understand why those ideas have been used?
- How does this link to the other ideas in the proof/other theorems/prior knowledge I have?
- does the self-explanation I have produced help answer those questions?

$\underline{\text{Example:}} \; (\text{Proof by contradiction})$
Statement:
$$\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, 2n+1=a+b+c, \quad \text{where } a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad \frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}, \frac{c}{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$$

Assume $x=a+b+c$, let $a=2k, b=2l, c=2m, \quad \text{where } k, l, m \in \mathbb{Z}$
$\therefore 2k + 2l + 2m = 2(k + l + m)$
$\dfrac{x}{2} = k+l+m$, but $k+l+m$ is an integer,
$\therefore$ by contradiction, $x$ must be even,
thus, no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.

### Self-explanation technique for understanding proofs

- "The proof aims to show that there exists no integer that can be expressed as a sum of three even integers by assuming it is true and then finding a contradiction."
- "The three integers can be rewritten as products of 2 and the remaining integer factor."
- "The formula is then rearranged such that $x$ must also satisfy the definition of an even integer."
- "Thus, no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers."
