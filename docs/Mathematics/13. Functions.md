# Functions

A *relation* between two variables $x$ and $y$, is any set of points which are on the $(x, y)$ plane.

There exist four different types of relations:

- One to one

- One to many
  
- Many to one
  
- Many to many

A *function* is defined as a mapping onto a single value. Therefore one to one, and many to one relations are considered to be functions.

## Testing if a relation is a function

1. **Algebraic Method:** 
		If we substitute any value of $x$ and it results in a singular $y$-value, then it can be considered a function.
2. **Graphical Method (Vertical Line Test):** 
		If we are given a plot of a function on the $(x, y)$ plane, where the $x$-axis is parallel with the horizontal, and the $y$-axis is parallel with the vertical, then if we are able to draw a vertical line anywhere on the graph, and it only intersects the plot once, it is a function. If the vertical line intersects the plot more than once, then it cannot be considered a function.
