# Combinatorics

## Basic Counting Principles

### Multiplication Principle

The *Fundamental Counting Principle* (or the *Multiplication Principle*) states that if an event can occur in $m$ ways, and another *independent* event is able to occur in $n$ ways, then the total number of unique ways both events can occur is:

$$
m \cdot n
$$

For example, if there are $m$ Formula 1 drivers, and $n$ Formula 1 cars, each driver can be paired with any car. Therefore there are a total of $mn$ different driverâ€“car combinations that can be made.

This principle can be generalised to any number of events. If there are $k$ independent events, where the the $i^{\text{th}}$ event can occur in $n_i$ ways, then the total number of unique ways all of the events can occur is:

$$
\boxed{n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot n_k}
$$

### Addition Principle

The *Addition Principle* states that given an event can occur in $m$ ways, and another *mutually exclusive* event (recall mutual exclusivity from **Chapter [[5. Sets]]**) can occur in $n$ ways, then the total number of ways either event can occur is:

$$
m + n
$$

Which can be generalised in the same way. If there are $k$ mutually exclusive events, where the the $i^{\text{th}}$ event can occur in $n_i$ ways, then the total number of possible outcomes is:

$$
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^k n_i}
$$

## Factorials

The *factorial* of a positive integer $n$ is written as $n!$, and defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to $n$:

$$
\boxed{n! = n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots 2 \cdot 1, \quad n \geq 1}
$$

And by convention, $0! = 1$.

## Permutations

A *permutation* is a unique ordering of a set of objects. For example $ABC$, and $CBA$ are both permutations of three letters $A$, $B$, and $C$.

>**Note:** If you take $AAB$, swapping the position of the two $A$s is still considered the same permutation, since the result is still $AAB$.

The number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects taken in groups of $r$ at a time, is written as $nPr$, is given by:

$$
\boxed{nPr = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}}
$$

From here we can see that if all $r$ objects ($r=n$):

$$
nPr = \dfrac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \dfrac{n!}{(0)!} = \dfrac{n!}{1} = n!
$$

So the special case where all objects are used ($r=n$):

$$
\boxed{ nPr = n! \quad \text{when } r = n }
$$
