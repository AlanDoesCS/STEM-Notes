# Combinatorics

## Basic Counting Principles

### Multiplication Principle

The *Fundamental Counting Principle* (or the *Multiplication Principle*) states that if an event can occur in $m$ ways, and another *independent* event is able to occur in $n$ ways, then the total number of unique ways both events can occur is:

$$
m \cdot n
$$

For example, if there are $m$ Formula 1 drivers, and $n$ Formula 1 cars, each driver can be paired with any car. Therefore there are a total of $mn$ different driverâ€“car combinations that can be made.

This principle can be generalised to any number of events. If there are $k$ independent events, where the $i^{\text{th}}$ event can occur in $n_i$ ways, then the total number of unique ways all of the events can occur is:

$$
\boxed{\prod_{i=1}^k n_i}
$$

### Addition Principle

The *Addition Principle* states that given an event can occur in $m$ ways, and another *mutually exclusive* event (recall mutual exclusivity from **Chapter [[5. Sets]]**) can occur in $n$ ways, then the total number of ways either event can occur is:

$$
m + n
$$

Which can be generalised in the same way. If there are $k$ mutually exclusive events, where the the $i^{\text{th}}$ event can occur in $n_i$ ways, then the total number of possible outcomes is:

$$
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^k n_i}
$$

## Factorials

The *factorial* of a positive integer $n$ is written as $n!$, and defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to $n$:

$$
\boxed{n! = \prod_{i=1}^n i, \quad n \geq 1}
$$

By convention, $0! = 1$.

## Permutations

A *permutation* is a unique ordering of a set of objects. For example $ABC$, and $CBA$ are both permutations of three letters $A$, $B$, and $C$.

>**Note:** If you take $AAB$, swapping the position of the two $A$s is still considered the same permutation, since the result is still $AAB$.

The number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects taken in groups of $r$ at a time, is written as $nPr$, is given by:

$$
\boxed{nPr = \dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!} \quad \text{(Assuming no identical objects)}}
$$

From here we can see that if all $r$ objects are used ($r=n$):

$$
nPr = \dfrac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \dfrac{n!}{(0)!} = \dfrac{n!}{1} = n!
$$

So the special case where all objects are used ($r=n$):

$$
\boxed{ nPr = n! \quad \text{when } r = n }
$$

### Permutations with Identical Objects

The formula for the number of permutations given earlier assumes all objects are distinct. In situations where some objects are identical (e.g. the example given earlier with $AAB$), there are fewer distinct permutations, as some are repeated.

The general formula is:

$$
\boxed{ \dfrac{n!}{ \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^r n_i! } }
$$

where $n$ is the total number of objects, $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_r$ are the counts for each group of identical objects.

## Combinations

A *combination* is a set of objects, meaning that order does not matter. For example $\{A, B, C\}$ and $\{C, B, A\}$ are the same combination of three letters, irrespective of the fact they are different permutations.

Since each group of $r$ objects can be arranged in $r!$ different orders, all representing the same combination, the number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects in groups of $r$, written as $nCr$ or $\binom{n}{r}$ ("n choose r"), is given by:

$$
\boxed{nCr = \binom{n}{r} = \dfrac{nPr}{r!} = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}}
$$

We also define that $nC0 = 1$ (there is one way to choose nothing), and $nCn=1$ (there is one way to choose all objects):

$$
\boxed{nC0 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad nCn = 1}
$$
