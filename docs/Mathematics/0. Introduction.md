# Introduction {-}

## Purpose of This Guide {-}

This handbook aims to be a concise yet comprehensive reference for key mathematical first principles, covering topics essential for high school mathematics, university preparation, and STEM-related fields. It is designed for fast navigation, allowing readers to look up topics easily, find clear explanations, quickly learn new topics or revise specific ones.

## How to Use This Handbook {-}

Each chapter focuses on a single topic, beginning with definitions and essential formulas. Mathematical notation follows a standardised convention throughout. Where topics are built upon, cross-references to other sections are included for further exploration or for revisiting relevant material.

## Notation and Conventions {-}

- Definitions are shown in *italics*.
- Variables are italicised (e.g. $x, y, z$).
- Constants such as $e$ or $\pi$ retain their standard mathematical meaning.
- Essential formulas are highlighted in boxes (e.g. $\boxed{e^{i\pi}+1=0}$).
- All angles are expressed in radians unless stated otherwise.
