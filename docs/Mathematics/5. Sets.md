# Sets

A *set* is a collection of distinct objects, called *elements* (or *members*). They are typically denoted by a capital letter (such as $A, B, C,$ etc.), and their elements can be written inside curly brackets. For example:

$$
A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, e, 9.\overline9, 8086 \}
$$

Here, $1 \in A$ denotes that "$1$ is an element of $A$", and $5 \notin A$ means that "$5$ is not an element of $A$".



## Types of Sets

| Name              | Description                                                                                       | Example                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Finite set**    | Contains a finite number of elements.                                                             | $B=\{1, 2, 3\}$                  |
| **Infinite set**  | Contains an infinite number of elements                                                           | $\mathbb{N}= \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ |
| **Singleton set** | Contains exactly one element.                                                                     | $C=\{256\}$                      |
| **Universal set** | Contains all objects under consideration in a certain context. Denoted as $U$.                    |                                  |
| **Empty set**     | (Sometimes called the *null set*) Contains no elements, and is denoted as $\varnothing$ or $\{\}$ |                                  |

## Subsets

A set $A$ is considered a *subset* of $B$ if every element in $A$ is also an element of $B$. In which case:

$$
A \subseteq B
$$

which means: "$A$ is a subset of or equal to $B$".

If $A$ is a subset of $B$, but $A \neq B$, then $A$ is considered a *proper subset* of $B$, shown as:

$$
A \subset B
$$

The empty set ($\varnothing$) is a subset of every set, including singletons, since it has no elements.




### -> mutual exclusivity

$$
A \cap B = \varnothing
$$
