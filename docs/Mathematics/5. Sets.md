# Sets

A *set* is a collection of distinct objects, called *elements* (or *members*). They are typically denoted by a capital letter (such as $A, B, C,$ etc.), and their elements can be written inside curly brackets. For example:

$$
A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, e, 9.\overline9, 8086 \}
$$

Here, $1 \in A$ denotes that "$1$ is an element of $A$", and $5 \notin A$ means that "$5$ is not an element of $A$".



## Types of Sets

| Name              | Description                                                                                       | Example                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Finite set**    | Contains a finite number of elements.                                                             | $B=\{1, 2, 3\}$                     |
| **Infinite set**  | Contains an infinite number of elements                                                           | $\mathbb{N}= \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ |
| **Singleton set** | Contains exactly one element.                                                                     | $C=\{256\}$                         |
| **Universal set** | Contains all objects under consideration in a certain context. Denoted as $U$.                    |                                     |
| **Empty set**     | (Sometimes called the *null set*) Contains no elements, and is denoted as $\varnothing$ or $\{\}$ |                                     |

## Subsets

A set $A$ is considered a *subset* of $B$ if every element in $A$ is also an element of $B$. In which case:

$$
A \subseteq B
$$

which means: "$A$ is a subset of or equal to $B$".

If $A$ is a subset of $B$, but $A \neq B$, then $A$ is considered a *proper subset* of $B$, shown as:

$$
A \subset B
$$

The empty set ($\varnothing$) is a subset of every set, including singletons, since it has no elements.

## Standard number sets

There are a range of standard number sets which the reader should be aware of:

| Symbol       | Set name         | Definition                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbb{N}$ | Natural numbers  | $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$                                              |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | Integers         | $\{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}$                                  |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | Rational numbers | $\tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0$                |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | Real numbers     | All $\mathbb{Q}$, as well as irrationals such as $\pi, e, \sqrt{2}$  |
| $\mathbb{C}$ | Complex numbers  | All numbers in the form $a+bi$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1$ |

As shown by Figure $5.1$, the sets are nested in the following way:

$$
\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}
$$

> **Note:** The set of natural numbers ($\mathbb{N}$) is sometimes defined to exclude $0$. In this book, we state that $0 \in \mathbb{N}$ for consistency. Complex numbers are introduced fully in **Chapter [[17. Complex Numbers]]**.

### Union

### Intersection

### Mutual exclusivity

$$
A \cap B = \varnothing
