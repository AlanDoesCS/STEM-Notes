# 1. Module Introduction

*Computer Architecture* is the science of creating computers, by putting together hardware components.

## Von Neuman Architecture

Most modern systems use the Von Neuman architecture.

## How Computer Architecture is Changing

The end of Moore's law:
- The physical and economic limits of how small and fast we can make transistors is being reached, meaning scaling is less plausible.

"Power wall"
- Increasing the clock speed leads to too much power being consumed, and excess heat production

## The proposed solution: Heterogeneous Computing
Different types of specialised processing units, on a single *chip*. (i.e. CPU, GPU, NPU, Memory, etc.)

CPU:
- A small pool of complex cores, where each core runs a few threads, but at high speed.

GPU:
- Ideal for processes which demand high throughput for parallel workloads.

NPU:
- Perform tensor mathematics for neural networks with high energy efficiency.
- Multiply-accumulate units arranged to perform matrix multiplication efficiently. (Keep in mind Strassen's Algorithm being $O(n^{\log_2 7})$, also look into other algorithms)
